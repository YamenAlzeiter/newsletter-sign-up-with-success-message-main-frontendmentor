## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- building web view first.
- modify the styles to be responsive in small screens.
- adding the the success popup into the the page and code the java script part that is responsible of validation and getting the email address into the span element in success popup.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

the page is not scroable in small screen for some reason, so... yeah I still need to figure out how to solve this problem.
